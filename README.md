# Denarius

Denarius is a highly-configurable Krist-based shop for modern ComputerCraft. It allows you to easily set up your own shop to sell items in modern ComputerCraft.

## Setup

Download the `denarius.lua`, `design.lua` and `config.lua` files:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Snowflake-Software/denarius/main/denarius.lua startup.lua
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Snowflake-Software/denarius/main/config.lua config.lua
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Snowflake-Software/denarius/main/design.lua design.lua
```

In the `config.lua` file, enter in your shop's name, the shops owner, your Krist credentials, and the items you will be selling. The config file should easily help you get started on making your shop.  
  
`design.lua` can be customized to personalize your shop. This file should also help you through it's process as well. 

## Building
Download the latest version of [mittere](https://github.com/Snowflake-Software/mittere), and run `mittere build`. An output file will be created in `denarius.lua`.

## Krist API
Denarius uses a currently work-in-progress Krist wrapped written by me. As stated, it is currently work-in-progress and not yet public. It will be as soon as it is fully complete!
